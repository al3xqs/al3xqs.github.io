Using wut is straightforward. Here’s a simple guide to get you started.

1. **Open your command line interface:**

2. **Navigate to your project directory:** 
   Use the `cd` command to change to the directory where your git project is located. For example:

   cd path/to/your/project
   ```

3. **Create a new worktree:**
   Run the following command:

   ```bash
   cd path/to/new/worktree
   ```
